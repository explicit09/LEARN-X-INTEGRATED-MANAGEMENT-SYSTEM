**Started**: 2025-07-19 03:15
**Session ID**: 2025-07-19-0315-careful-lims-dashboard-implementation

## Session Overview
- **Objective**: Carefully implement LIMS dashboard with Cmd+Shift+G toggle and task management to replace ClickUp
- **Branch**: main
- **LIMS Components**: Dashboard UI, Task Management, Database Schema Extensions
- **Approach**: Ultra-careful implementation with deep thinking on architecture

## Goals
- [ ] Implement Cmd+Shift+G shortcut to toggle LIMS dashboard
- [ ] Build simple dashboard using Glass app components and design
- [ ] Create task management module to replace ClickUp
- [ ] Carefully extend database schema without breaking existing functionality
- [ ] Maintain consistency with Glass app UI/UX

## Initial System State
### Git Status
```
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  M .claude/sessions/.current-session
  ?? .claude/settings.local.json
  ?? .mcp.json
  ?? glass-clean/
```

### Database Status
- **Existing Tables**: tasks, projects, epics, teams, users, documents, analytics_events
- **Task Table Structure**: id, project_id, epic_id, title, description, status, priority, assignee_id, story_points, time_estimate, time_spent, due_date, position
- **Project Table Structure**: id, name, description, start_date, end_date, status, project_type, sprint_duration

### LIMS Status
- **Database**: Supabase connected (fbcnvebsrbtgxxumrrma)
- **Current Focus**: Task Management Module
- **UI Framework**: Glass app components (Electron)

## Progress Log
### 03:15 - Session Started
- Analyzed existing database structure
- Identified tables and fields that need extension
- Planning careful implementation approach

### 03:30 - Implemented LIMS Dashboard Foundation
- ‚úÖ Added Cmd+Shift+G shortcut to shortcuts service
- ‚úÖ Created LIMS dashboard window in window manager
- ‚úÖ Implemented window toggle functionality
- ‚úÖ Created LimsDashboardView UI component with Glass app styling
- ‚úÖ Added LIMS to PickleGlassApp view router
- ‚úÖ Created limsService for backend operations
- ‚úÖ Added LIMS API to preload script
- ‚úÖ Registered IPC handlers in featureBridge
- ‚úÖ Extended database schema with LIMS-specific tables:
  - sprints table for sprint management
  - task_labels for flexible categorization
  - task_comments for discussions
  - task_dependencies for blocking relationships
  - Added fields to tasks: sprint_id, completion_percentage, labels, ai_insights
  - Added fields to projects: lims_config, integration_settings

## Implementation Status
‚úÖ **Phase 1: Dashboard Toggle (Cmd+Shift+G)** - COMPLETED
   - ‚úÖ Registered global shortcut in main process
   - ‚úÖ Created LIMS dashboard window
   - ‚úÖ Implemented toggle functionality
   - ‚úÖ Used Glass app window management patterns

‚úÖ **Phase 2: Simple Dashboard UI** - COMPLETED
   - ‚úÖ Reused Glass app components
   - ‚úÖ Progressive disclosure design with tabs
   - ‚úÖ Task overview widget with metrics
   - ‚úÖ Quick actions panel (create task button)

‚úÖ **Phase 3: Database Extensions (Careful)** - COMPLETED
   - ‚úÖ Added sprint management table
   - ‚úÖ Extended tasks with LIMS fields (sprint_id, completion_percentage, labels, ai_insights)
   - ‚úÖ Created workflow tables (task_labels, task_comments, task_dependencies)
   - ‚úÖ Maintained backward compatibility

üîÑ **Phase 4: Task Management Core** - IN PROGRESS
   - ‚úÖ Basic CRUD operations for tasks
   - ‚è≥ Sprint planning features
   - ‚è≥ Task dependencies UI
   - ‚è≥ ClickUp migration tools

## Technical Decisions
- Use existing Glass app components for UI consistency
- Extend rather than replace existing database tables
- Implement features incrementally with careful testing
- Focus on task management as primary use case
