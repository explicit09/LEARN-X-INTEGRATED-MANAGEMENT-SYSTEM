3. Build sprint planning interface
4. Create task filtering and search
5. Implement ClickUp data import tools

## Final Summary
Successfully implemented a fully functional LIMS dashboard with careful attention to:
- Maintaining Glass app UI/UX consistency
- Extending database schema without breaking existing features
- Creating a solid foundation for task management to replace ClickUp
- Using the same component patterns and design language as Glass app

The LIMS dashboard is now accessible via Cmd+Shift+G and provides:
