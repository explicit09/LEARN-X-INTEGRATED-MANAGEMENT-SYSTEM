## Issues & Solutions
*Problems and fixes will be documented here*

## Research Foundation (From Previous Session Parallel Agents)

### Agent 1: ClickUp Feature Analysis - Key Findings
#### Essential Features to Implement (Priority Order)
1. **Core Task Management**: CRUD operations, status management, assignments ✅ *Already implemented*
2. **Custom Workflows**: 4-level status system (Todo → In Progress → Review → Done) ✅ *Already implemented*
3. **Priority System**: Urgent, High, Normal, Low with visual indicators ✅ *Already implemented*
4. **Kanban + List Views**: Visual workflow + spreadsheet-style ✅ *Already implemented*
5. **Time Management**: Due dates, time tracking, scheduling *→ Next priority*
6. **Dependencies**: Waiting on, Blocking, Linked relationships *→ Phase 3*

#### Pain Points to Avoid
- **Performance Issues**: 71% of ClickUp users report speed problems
- **Steep Learning Curve**: Overwhelming complexity for new users
- **Mobile Limitations**: Desktop parity lacking
- **Notification Overload**: Too many alerts reduce productivity

#### Most Used Workflow Pattern
- **Primary**: To Do → In Progress → Review → Done (matches our implementation)
- **Templates**: Pre-configured task structures for recurring work
- **Bulk Operations**: Mass editing, status changes, assignments

### Agent 2: Modern UX Best Practices - Key Patterns
#### Speed & Efficiency Principles
1. **Command-First UX**: Cmd/Ctrl+K universal command palette
2. **Single-Key Shortcuts**: C (create), X (select), E (edit), D (done)
3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Three-tier information hierarchy
4. **Optimistic Updates**: Show changes immediately, sync in background

#### Leading Platform Insights
- **Linear**: Command palette + single-letter shortcuts + dark mode excellence
- **Notion**: Flexible property system + multiple view types + template system
- **Height**: AI-powered features + screenshot integration + context-aware UI
- **Todoist**: Natural language processing + gamification + minimalist design

#### Critical UX Patterns
```
Task Creation Flow:
1. Quick add with natural language ("Review lab results Friday")
2. Auto-populate context (current project, assignee defaults)
3. Progressive disclosure for additional properties
4. One-click duplication for similar tasks

Information Hierarchy:
Tier 1 (Always visible): Title, status, assignee, due date
Tier 2 (On hover/expand): Description, labels, priority  
Tier 3 (On click): Comments, attachments, subtasks, history
```

### Agent 3: Drag-and-Drop Implementation - Technical Specifications
#### Library Recommendation: @dnd-kit
**Why chosen over alternatives:**
- react-beautiful-dnd is deprecated (archived April 2025)
- Superior accessibility with WCAG 2.2 compliance
- Performance optimized for large datasets
- Active maintenance and growing ecosystem

#### Required Packages
```bash
npm install @dnd-kit/core @dnd-kit/sortable @dnd-kit/utilities @dnd-kit/modifiers
```

#### Component Architecture
```typescript
KanbanBoard
├── DndContext (root context)
├── BoardColumns
│   ├── SortableContext (column sorting)
│   └── TaskColumn
│       ├── SortableContext (task sorting)
│       └── TaskCard (draggable)
├── DragOverlay (visual feedback)
└── DropZoneIndicator
```

#### Performance Targets
- **Task creation**: < 200ms from input to display
- **View switching**: < 100ms transition time
- **Drag operations**: 60fps smooth animations
- **Large datasets**: Virtual scrolling for 1000+ tasks

### Update 20:20 - Priority Features Roadmap Added
**Summary**: Analyzed current system gaps and defined priority features for next development phases

#### Features Prioritized:
1. **Search & Filtering** - Critical for finding tasks quickly
2. **Assignees & User Management** - Essential for team collaboration
3. **Bulk Operations** - Leveraging existing multi-select capability
4. **Comments/Activity History** - Collaboration and audit trail
5. **Due Dates & Time Management** - Task scheduling and tracking

#### Rationale:
- Current system has excellent drag-and-drop and UI
- Missing core productivity features that users expect
- Search is #1 priority - without it, system becomes unusable at scale
- Assignees enable team usage beyond single user
- These features complement the existing enhanced task management

### Update 20:32 - Modular Search and Filter Architecture Implemented
**Summary**: Successfully implemented modular architecture for search and filtering without modifying the 4000-line core module

#### Activities Completed
- ✅ Created modular directory structure for task management features
- ✅ Implemented TaskEventBus for loose coupling between modules
- ✅ Built TaskSearchModule with:
  - Real-time search with debouncing
  - Search operators (status:todo, priority:high, due:today)
  - Search suggestions and history
  - Cmd+F keyboard shortcut
- ✅ Built TaskFilterModule with:
  - Multi-select filters for status and priority
  - Date range filtering
  - Label filtering support
  - Filter presets (My Tasks, Due Soon, High Priority)
  - Active filter chips with remove buttons
- ✅ Created TaskManagementIntegration layer for connecting modules
- ✅ Extended TaskManagementModuleEnhanced via composition
- ✅ Integrated search and filters into the UI seamlessly

#### Technical Architecture
```
src/ui/lims/modules/
├── TaskManagementModuleEnhanced.js (4000 lines - unchanged)
├── TaskManagementModuleWithSearch.js (extends with search/filter)
└── taskManagement/
    ├── search/

    ├── filters/
    │   └── TaskFilterModule.js
    ├── utils/
    │   └── TaskEventBus.js
    └── TaskManagementIntegration.js
```

#### Key Design Decisions
- **Composition over Modification**: Created wrapper module instead of editing core
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Modules communicate via event bus
- **Web Components**: Each feature is a self-contained LitElement component
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Features layer on top of existing functionality

#### Next Priority Features
1. Assignee Management UI
2. Bulk Operations (leveraging existing multi-select)
3. Comments/Activity History
4. Due Date Management

  - src/features/lims/limsService.js (found hidden backend features)
  - src/ui/lims/modules/TaskManagementModuleEnhanced.js (found bugs)
- **Key discoveries**: 
  - Multi-select works with Shift/Cmd/Ctrl+click
  - Time tracking fields exist in database
  - Sprint management API ready
  - Real-time subscriptions active

#### Updated Progress Assessment
- **Total Features Planned**: 24
