# LEARN-X Analytics Implementation Action Items - UPDATED

**Priority**: MEDIUM  
**Date**: January 21, 2025

## 🚨 Not Implemented (But Not Critical - No Payment System Yet)

### 1. Subscription & Revenue Tracking
```python
# File: microlessons/backend/services/subscription_service.py (create if needed)

# When user subscribes
await analytics.emit(
    EventType.SUBSCRIPTION_CREATED,  # Add to EventType enum
    user_id=user.id,
    plan_type=plan.name,
    price=plan.price,
    billing_period=plan.billing_period
)

# When user upgrades/downgrades
await analytics.emit(
    EventType.SUBSCRIPTION_UPGRADED,  # Add to enum
    user_id=user.id,
    from_plan=old_plan.name,
    to_plan=new_plan.name,
    price_difference=new_plan.price - old_plan.price
)

# When payment processes
await analytics.emit(
    EventType.PAYMENT_PROCESSED,  # Add to enum
    user_id=user.id,
    amount=payment.amount,
    payment_method=payment.method,
    subscription_id=subscription.id
)
```

## 📋 Configuration Required for Glass LIMS Integration

### 1. Add Environment Variables to LEARN-X Backend
```bash
# Glass LIMS Supabase Configuration (for analytics events)
GLASS_LIMS_SUPABASE_URL=https://fbcnvebsrbtgxxumrrma.supabase.co
GLASS_LIMS_SUPABASE_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6ImZiY252ZWJzcmJ0Z3h4dW1ycm1hIiwicm9sZSI6InNlcnZpY2Vfcm9sZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1MDg2ODMwMiwiZXhwIjoyMDY2NDQ0MzAyfQ.W0sGDbmEDdTtFWaIqKxvOX58dn1N06qJQS1p97mTxvU

# Ensure analytics are enabled
ANALYTICS_ENABLED=true
```

### 2. Verify Event Emitter is Using Glass LIMS Credentials
The event emitter in `microlessons/backend/services/analytics/event_emitter.py` should already prioritize Glass LIMS credentials when available.

## ⚠️ Fix Event Type Inconsistencies

### 1. Add Missing Enum Values
```python
# File: microlessons/backend/services/analytics/event_schemas.py

class EventType(str, Enum):
    # Add these missing values that are being used:
    LOW_ENGAGEMENT_DETECTED = "low_engagement_detected"
    API_REQUEST = "api_request"
    SESSION_STARTED = "session_started"
    PAGE_VIEWED = "page_viewed"
    COMPLETION_RATE_CALCULATED = "completion_rate_calculated"
    TIME_TO_COMPLETE_CALCULATED = "time_to_complete_calculated"
    LEARNING_PROGRESS_CALCULATED = "learning_progress_calculated"
    QUIZ_PERFORMANCE_CALCULATED = "quiz_performance_calculated"
    USER_CHURN_RISK_HIGH = "user_churn_risk_high"
    CHURN_ANALYSIS_COMPLETED = "churn_analysis_completed"
```

### 2. Convert String Events to Enum
```python
# WRONG - Don't use strings
await analytics.emit("api_request", ...)

# CORRECT - Use enum
await analytics.emit(EventType.API_REQUEST, ...)
```

## 🔧 Minor Improvements (Optional)

### 1. Add Missing User Context
While events are being tracked, consider adding user context fields for better analytics:
```typescript
// When tracking events, include:
user_tier: user.subscription_tier  // "free", "premium", "enterprise"
user_created_at: user.created_at
```

### 2. Onboarding Flow Events
Some onboarding events are defined but not yet tracked:
- `ONBOARDING_STARTED`
- `ONBOARDING_STEP_COMPLETED`
- `ONBOARDING_COMPLETED`
- `ONBOARDING_SKIPPED`

### 3. Canvas Integration Events
When Canvas features are fully implemented, ensure tracking for:
- `CANVAS_SYNC_STARTED`
- `CANVAS_SYNC_COMPLETED`
- `CANVAS_COURSE_IMPORTED`

## 🚀 Key Strengths of Current Implementation

1. **Comprehensive Frontend Tracking**:
   - Sophisticated batching system for efficiency
   - Retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Ad-blocker detection and fallback endpoints
   - Non-blocking analytics that never break the app

2. **Redundant Backend Tracking**:
   - Auth middleware tracks login/registration
   - Provides fallback if frontend tracking fails

3. **Event Coverage**:
   - All critical user journey events are tracked
   - Learning engagement fully instrumented
   - Interactive features comprehensively tracked

## 📋 Current Event Flow Testing

These events are already being sent to Glass LIMS:

- ✅ User login → `USER_LOGIN` event
- ✅ Start lesson → `LESSON_STARTED` event  
- ✅ Complete lesson → `LESSON_COMPLETED` event
- ✅ Take quiz → `QUIZ_STARTED`, `QUIZ_COMPLETED` events
- ✅ Rate lesson → `lesson_rated`, `feedback_submitted` events
- ⏳ Create subscription → `SUBSCRIPTION_CREATED` event (when payment system is built)
- ⏳ Process payment → `PAYMENT_PROCESSED` event (when payment system is built)

## 🔍 How to Verify Events are Being Sent

```sql
-- Connect to Glass LIMS Supabase
-- Check recent events in queue
SELECT * FROM pgmq_read('analytics_events', 30, 10);

-- Check processed events
SELECT event_type, COUNT(*) 
FROM analytics_events 
WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
GROUP BY event_type
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;
```

## 📈 Summary

LEARN-X has a mature analytics implementation that tracks all critical business events except subscription/payment (which don't exist yet). The main action item is to configure the Glass LIMS Supabase credentials in the LEARN-X backend environment to enable event flow to the LIMS analytics pipeline.
