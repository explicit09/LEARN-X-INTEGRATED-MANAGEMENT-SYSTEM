## Recommendations

1. **Next Sprint Focus** (High Impact, Quick Wins):
   - Task Templates (partially built UI exists)
   - Time Tracking (high user value)
   - Label Management (improves organization)

2. **Following Sprint**:
   - Task Dependencies (complex but valuable)
   - Sprint Management (ties into dependencies)
   - Optimistic UI (improves perceived performance)

3. **Future Considerations**:
   - Real-time collaboration (requires WebSocket infrastructure)
   - Advanced reporting (requires analytics engine)
   - LIMS module integration (requires architectural planning)

## Technical Debt

1. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Virtual scrolling implemented but needs testing with 1000+ tasks
   - Consider implementing windowing for list view

2. **Code Organization**:
   - TaskManagementModuleEnhanced.js is ~4000 lines
   - Consider further modularization

3. **Testing**:
   - No automated tests mentioned
   - Need unit tests for critical functions
   - E2E tests for user workflows

4. **Documentation**:
   - API documentation needed
   - User guide for advanced features
   - Developer documentation for extending modules
